(\) FACT - PUBLIC DOMAIN OTHERWISE


Mod configs for Minecraft 1.5.2


For public mods which might be expected in, or often added to, an FTB Ultimate replacement.


I believe this information is most likely considered entirely fact and thus not coverable by copyright.  If I am incorrect and any of this information might be attributable to me, I release that information to PUBLIC DOMAIN.


If there is a mod you are expecting configs for, but do not see configs, that is because as of the date I compiled this information a public version of that mod was not avaliable for testing / generation of configs.  Hopefully in the future the mod authors will make it very slightly better known in some areas where their alpha-test versions are.


Thank you for modding, the mod authors the most, and also the players I spend too much time with.
